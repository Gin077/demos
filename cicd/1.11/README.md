# Continuous Delivery with GitLab and Jenkins

This demo presents a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflow using GitLab and Jenkins on DC/OS. In this demo weâ€™ll be creating a simple website, testing it to make sure all the links work, and then deploying it in production if it passes.

- Estimated time for completion: 30min
- Target audience: Anyone interested in simplifying the deployment of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Architecture

## Prerequisites

- A running [DC/OS 1.10](https://dcos.io/releases/) or higher cluster with at least 3 private agents and 1 public agent. Each agent should have 2 CPUs and 5 GB of RAM available. The [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.11/usage/cli/install/) also needs to be installed.
- The [dcos/demo](https://github.com/dcos/demos/) Git repo must be available locally, use: `git clone https://github.com/dcos/demos/` if you haven't done so yet.
- [SSH](https://dcos.io/docs/1.11/administration/access-node/sshcluster/) cluster access must be set up.
- Ports 22222 and 50000 opened on the public agent where Marathon-lb is running.
- The ability to add a DNS A record to use for GitLab that you and the cluster have access to, if you don't have a domain or run DNS, you may use a free service like <a href="https://www.noip.com/">noip.com</a>.

The DC/OS services used in the demo are as follows:

- GitLab
- Jenkins
- Marathon-lb

## Setup

Get the <a href="https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.11/administering-clusters/locate-public-agent/">address of your public agent</a> and set up a DNS A record to use for GitLab. In this demo we'll be using cd.example.com, you'll want to replace this in all examples.

If you have SSL certificates configured which will be used by the Public Agent, you're all set. Otherwise, you'll want to log into your private nodes and configure Docker to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/">use an insecure registry</a>. Using an insecure registry is not appropriate for production, but for the purpose of a private demo it may be used:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/insecure-registry.conf
```

The contents of insecure-registry.conf should be the following:

```
[Service]
Environment='DOCKER_OPTS=--insecure-registry=cd.example.com:50000'
```

Remember to replace `cd.example.com` with the A record you have pointed at your public agent.

Now reload Docker and confirm the parameter has been passed:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
systemctl show --property=Environment docker
```

Warning: By default, restarting Docker will cause your running containers to restart.

Later, we will also need to configure Jenkins to pull from an insecure registry during the deployment step.

## Install

Now you'll want to install Marathon-LB. We're not making any changes, so it's easy to simply do this from the DC/OS CLI if you wish:

```
dcos package install marathon-lb
```

Next, install Jenkins. In production you'll want to make sure Jenkins is running on one of the nodes where shared, persistent storage is located. For this demo it's fine to simply pin it to a private node of your choosing and save the files in /tmp on that node. Pinning to a node can easily be done by installing Jenkins through the web UI and filling out the Storage tab and setting a "Pinned Hostname" that points to one of your private nodes.

Once Jenkins is installed, if you don't have SSL certificates set up you'll need to configure Jenkins to accept the insecure registry you set up. This can be completed by referencing the <a href="https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/jenkins/advanced-configuration/">Jenkins Advanced Configuration</a> section of the documentation.

Now it's time to install GitLab. Just like Jenkins, we'll want to pin this to a hostname for this demo just in case the container restarts. In a production environment you'll want to mount external storage shared storage so that GitLab can move between nodes, but for a quick demo you may use the limited in-container non-persistent storage. In order to pin it to a node, go into the "Single Node" section of the configuration and put in the IP address of the private node you wish to run it on in the section for "pinned hostname".

You'll also want to set the "virtual host" in the routing section to match the name you created in DNS.

This concludes the tooling you need installed, you can now log into GitLab and get started setting up your repository and deployment pipeline!

## Set Up Job

Configure job in Jenkins

- Support custom Git repository for website HTML files
- Build website Docker image
- Upload to GitLab Docker registry
- UCR to launch the Docker image for testing with http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/
- Once passed, launch Docker image with UCR into production
